#This Ansible play cleans out the default libvirt image store location (/var/lib/libvirt/images), by deleting the directory and re-creating it. The play spares only the master VM image by first moving it to a temporary directory and then putting it back. Pre-conditions: this play assumes that all VMs are shutdown and have been undefined.
