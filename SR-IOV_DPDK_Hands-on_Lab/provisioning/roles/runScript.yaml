#This script is a generic script that copies a specified script to remote inventory and then executes it as root. 
# Input parameters: 
#   provisioning_slave_dir: this is the directory on the remote node into which the script file is copied. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts.
#   provisioning_master_dir: this is the Ansible root directory on the Ansible controller. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts
#   relative_source_path: this is a path relative to provisioning_master_dir in which the script file is located. This variable MUST be defined on the command line when instantiating this Ansible role.
#   script_name: this is the name of the script that is found at provisioning_master_dir/relative_source_path and which will be copied to provisioning_slave_dir on the remote node and then executed. This variable MUST be defined on the command line when instantiating this Ansible role.
