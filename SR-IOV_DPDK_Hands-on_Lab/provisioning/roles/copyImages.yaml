#This Ansible play was used to prepare for the cloneImages.yaml play. It copies the HostVM-Master domain definition XML file and image files to the target inventory. This play has two pre-conditions: 
#   1. the HostVM-Master.qcow2 image must be located at /var/lib/libvirt/images on the ansible controller node. 
#   2. the HostVM-Master.xml domain definition file must be located at {{ provisioning_master_dir }}.

# This role has several input parameters:
#   provisioning_slave_dir: this is the directory on the remote node into which the script file is copied. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts.
#   provisioning_master_dir: this is the Ansible root directory on the Ansible controller. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts.
