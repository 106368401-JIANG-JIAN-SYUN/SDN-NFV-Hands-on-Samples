#This Ansible play copies a file to the inventory by 1) removing the existing file from the remote system; 2) copying the file to a temp location on the remote system; 3) moving the file to the right location on the remote system; and 4) changing file ownership. The play has one input parameter:
# provisioning_master_dir: this is the Ansible root directory on the Ansible controller. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts.
