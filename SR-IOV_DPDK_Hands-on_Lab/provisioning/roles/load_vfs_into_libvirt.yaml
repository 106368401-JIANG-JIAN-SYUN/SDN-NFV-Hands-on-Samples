#The load_vs_into_libvirt.yaml play loads the SR-IOV Virtual Functions into libvirt networks. It has four tasks:
#   1.	Copy the 02_load_vfs_into_libvirt.sh script to the compute node;
#   2.	Change the owner of the script to root and make it executable;
#   3.	Copy the SR-IOV libvirt network definition XML files to the compute node; and
#   4.	Execute the 02_load_vfs_into_libvirt.sh script on the compute node.
#This play has several input parameters:
#   provisioning_slave_dir: this is the directory on the remote node into which the script file is copied. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts.
#   provisioning_master_dir: this is the Ansible root directory on the Ansible controller. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts
