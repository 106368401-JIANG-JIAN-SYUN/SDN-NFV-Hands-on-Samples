#The snapshotGuestVMs.yaml Ansible play copied the snapshotGuest.sh script from the ../scripts directory to the remote compute nodes, and then ran that script. See the snapshotGuestVMs.sh script for more information. 
#This play has several input parameters:
#   provisioning_slave_dir: this is the directory on the remote node into which the script file is copied. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts.
#   provisioning_master_dir: this is the Ansible root directory on the Ansible controller. This variable is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts.
